The goal was to create an Amazon-like store front using Node.js and MySQL.

# Getting Started
* Clone repo.
* Run command in Terminal or Gitbash 'npm install'
* Run command depending which mode you would like to be on:
* Customer - 'npm run customer'
* Run 'ctrl + c' to exit 


Prints the products in the store.

Prompts customer which product they would like to purchase by ID number.

Asks for the quantity.

If there is a sufficient amount of the product in stock, it will return the total for that purchase.
However, if there is not enough of the product in stock, it will tell the user that there isn't enough of the product.
If the purchase goes through, it updates the stock quantity to reflect the purchase.

* Add New Product
* End Session
